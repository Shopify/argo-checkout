## Best practices

- Unlike HTML headings, you don’t explicitly specify the position of the heading in the document outline. Nest headings within the heading group component, to control the document outline structure used by assistive technologies.
- Clearly describe the section of interface they refer to.
- Highlight the most important concept or piece of information customers need to know.
- Sits at the top of the section of interface they’re referring to.
